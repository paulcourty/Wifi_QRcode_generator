I wrote a small script to generate Wifi QRcodes. It's practical for friends coming over, they can connect to the wifi within seconds taking a picture!

The 2 scripts (Notebook & Python script) essentially do the same thing, so run the one that you're most comfortable with. Both try to retrieve your wifi information directly from your laptop, otherwise they ask you to type the info manually.

Here is an example of the output:
